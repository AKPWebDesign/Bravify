# Bravify

Bravify is a tool to generate builds for [Ultimate Bravery](http://customlol.wikia.com/wiki/Ultimate_Bravery), a custom game mode in League of Legends. While there already exists a [tool to generate builds](http://ultimate-bravery.com), I've found that the tool uses outdated information, and isn't generally the easiest to use, either. What Bravify does differently is that it uses the Riot Games API directly, allowing the information used to be always up-to-date.

## Usage

In order to use Bravify, you just open `Bravify.exe`. You may be asked to choose where the League of Legends folder is upon first starting Bravify, if you installed League in a non-default location. It will then download the needed information from Riot's API, generate a build for you, and allow you to see the build. If you don't like the build, or don't own the champion it chose for you, you can click the `U wot m8?` button to generate a new build. You can also choose a different map using the map choice dropdown button, and choose the champions to pick from using the `Choose Champions` button.  

When you're ready to play, you can click the `Save build` button to save the current build as a custom [Item Set](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752904-Item-Sets-), which will then be available to see in the in-game shop. Next, you simply need to start your game, ensuring to choose the champion, masteries, and summoner spells that Bravify generated, and you're on your way to the Ultimate Victory!
