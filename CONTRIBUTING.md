## Contributing

So, you want to contribute to Bravify. It's pretty simple, actually. Just fork the repository on GitHub, make the changes that you'd like to see made ([preferably in a new branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)), then submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), and if the Bravify team likes your contribution, we'll accept the Pull Request and put your changes in the app.
